Documentation of python-cctalk
==============================

This package includes a module to send ccTalk messages and decode
replies from a coin validator. Can be easily extended to include any
ccTalk message for use with any device.

This package was created with and includes only free software.  Since
this package makes use of hardware that did not have existing free
software to control it, we decided to write our own package to support
this.

The python-cctalk library uses python-serial to communicate with
ccTalk coin validators.  This module is only possible thanks to the
excellent python-serial package.

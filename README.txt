README for python-cctalk
========================

This package allows one to send ccTalk messages and decode replies 
from a coin validator. This code can be easily extended to include any
ccTalk message for use with any device.  Since this package makes use
of hardware that did not have existing free software to control it, we
decided to write our own package to support this.

This package was created with and includes only free software and is
licensed under GPLv3 or any later version.  A copy of this license 
is found in the file gpl-3.0.txt.  

The python-cctalk library uses the excellent python-serial to communicate 
with ccTalk coin validators.  

Examples and details are available in the Sphinx documentation.
